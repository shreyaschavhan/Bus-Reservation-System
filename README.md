# Bus Reservation System
> Description : 
> This C++ project is aimed at computerizing travelling company manual booking in order to maintain records of passengers, schedule and detail of each bus. With the bus reservation system, we  can manage reservations, client data, and passenger lists. We can also schedule routes, set seat availability, upload an interactive seat map and let customers select their seats.

##  Introduction
This Project deals with maintenance records of details about each passenger, schedule and details of each bus. 
It helps you schedule bus routes and tours with ease. The system allows you to plan, schedule and manage unlimited routes with start, end and stop destinations, create a route timetable, print bus schedules, seat and passenger lists.The built-in reservation management system allows script admins to add, edit and delete bookings,
manage clients' details and tickets. The bus reservation system allows you to manually process bookings.
